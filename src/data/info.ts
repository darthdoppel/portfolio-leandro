  about: `
  and currently exploring opportunities as a Fullstack Developer, I have a strong inclination towards Backend development, while my skills in Frontend, enriched by libraries like NextUI and the use of TailwindCSS, ensure adaptability to a variety of project requirements. My tech journey involves self-learning and implementing technologies like JavaScript, React, TypeScript, NodeJS, MongoDB, and ExpressJS. My learning quest continues, leading to the successful completion of several independent web projects. I am passionate about devising solutions that address real-world problems, striving to make people’s work less repetitive and more focused on creating value.
